NDN Team is organizing the 2nd NDN Hackathon on March 21-22, 2016 at UC San Diego Campus in La Jolla, CA.  We solicit hack proposals that advance the state of NDN.  Participants will have approximately **12 hours** to work on the projects. 

We are looking for projects that belong to any of the following categories:

 - directly address NDN research needs,
 - create new NDN tools or modify existing tools
 - create or improve documentation and how-to guides.
