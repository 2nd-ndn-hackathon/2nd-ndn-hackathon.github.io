title: Welcome to 2nd NDN Hackathon
---

NDN Team is organizing the 2nd NDN Hackathon on March 21-22, 2016 on San Diego Campus in La Jolla, CA.  We solicit hack proposals that advance the state of NDN.

We are looking for projects that will:

- directly address a research need,
- create new NDN tools or modify existing tools
- create or improve documentation and how-to guides.

Participants will have approximately **12 hours** to work on the projects.
