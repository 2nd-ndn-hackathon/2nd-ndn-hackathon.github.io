title: Welcome to 2nd NDN Hackathon
---

The NDN Team is organizing our 2nd NDN Hackathon to be held on March 20-21, 2016 on the UC San Diego Campus in La Jolla, CA.  We solicit Hackathon project proposals that advance the state of NDN.  Participants will have approximately **12 hours** to work on the projects. 

We encourage projects that:

 - directly address NDN research needs,
 - create new NDN tools or modify existing tools,
 - create or improve documentation and how-to guides.
