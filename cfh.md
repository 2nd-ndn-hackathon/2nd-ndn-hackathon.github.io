title: Call for Hacks
---
NDN Team is organizing the 2nd NDN Hackathon on March 21-22, 2016 at UC San Diego Campus in La Jolla, CA. We solicit hack proposals that advance the state of NDN. Participants will have approximately 12 hours to work on the projects.

We are looking for projects that belong to any of the following categories:

 - directly address a NDN research need,
 - create new NDN tools or modify existing tools
 - create or improve documentation and how-to guides.


## Submission guidelines

Proposals should be submitted via email to [2nd-ndn-hackathon@named-data.net](mailto:2nd-ndn-hackathon@named-data.net?subject=[2nd%20NDN%20Hackathon%20Submission])

The submissions should include:

- 1 page description PDF, including contact information about submitters and project leader(s), problem statement, approach, contribution to NDN, planned tasks to accomplish, knowledge requirements, and what is expected outcome by the end of the hackathon

- 1 or 2 PPTx slides, listing the project leader(s) and summarizing the problem, contribution, tasks, required knowledge, and expected outcome

All the submitted proposals will be reviewed by the Hacking Committee.  If accepted, the project leader is expected to give a 5 minute “pitch” presentation in the beginning of the Hackathon, soliciting participation from the Hackathon participants.

Projects will be judged by a panel for the “Best of Hackathon” prize. We hope that the hackathon will be a fun event for all and that projects will lead to collaborations extending beyond NDNcomm.


## Additional information

### How open-ended should proposals be?

Ideally, project proposals should include room for discussion and cooperative design during the hackathon, but may be entirely planned in advance (e.g. a new NFD feature). We ask that proposals avoid larger projects that are completely open to design. The significance of the contribution is more important than spectacle.

### Who will work on the projects?

Hackathon projects will be developed by small teams (< 8) and should be able to show measurable progress after two days. Participants will be encouraged to regroup and refresh overnight. The hackathon welcomes all interested participants, regardless of NDN experience, so we are seeking projects that are suitable for experienced NDN developers as well as those approachable by newcomers. For example, a project could decompose into tasks of varying skill levels or, alternatively, be specifically targeted.

### What languages, libraries, etc. are allowed?

Project proposals should declare any programming language, library, platform requirements, and so forth. For new projects, we ask you to consider how the specifics, such as language choice, may impact the ability to attract participants. The hackathon organizers will provide
proposal feedback and assistance to ensure projects have a concrete path to implementation.

### If I propose a project, do I have to go to the Hackathon?

Proposals must specify one or more representatives who will attend the hackathon to pitch their idea and guide its development over the duration of the hackathon (hacking optional). Representatives will have 5 minutes to present their idea to attendees at the event opening. The pitch should emphasize the project's motivation and use cases.
